			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>
				Merhaba!! Which means "Hi" in Turkish. Yes I am Turkish. I moved to Boulder from Istanbul right after my graduation from college. After living two and a half years in Boulder, it was time for me to move in Denver. I love being closed to mountains. Skiing, hiking and running in the mountains are so much fun. Sounds like Coloradian ha?
